The previous AI engineer initiated the development of a full-stack application following a detailed system prompt. The project began with a focus on building a conversion-optimized landing page, emphasizing agency-quality design, glass-morphism, and a specific dark-themed UI/UX playbook (UIX-Labs). The development proceeded iteratively: first, a frontend-only mock was built, incorporating user design preferences for hero section, CTA colors, and navigation.

After the initial frontend mock was reviewed (which exposed a React error after a production-ready polish), the AI engineer successfully debugged and resolved the UI issues. Following user confirmation, the focus shifted to backend development. The engineer implemented a FastAPI backend with MongoDB, establishing CRUD operations for all specified entities (Blogs, Tools, Path, Community) and defining API contracts. The backend was then thoroughly tested and confirmed to be fully functional. The current state is a polished frontend still relying on mock data, and a robust, tested backend ready for integration.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to build a full-stack application, starting with a conversion-optimized landing page. This MVP must meet agency-quality standards, featuring layered design (z-index), visually distinct CTA sections using color psychology, stylish accordions with smooth animations, and glass-morphism effects (12-24px blur). The design should evoke emotional impact, deliver clear messaging, and provide intuitive navigation with visual cues.

Specific UI/UX requirements dictated by the user and the UIX-Labs playbook include:
- A dark-themed foundation (, ).
- High-contrast text ().
- Accent color for CTAs:  (cyan-green).
- Sharp-edged buttons for primary/secondary actions.
- A fixed dark navigation header.
- A grid layout with a pattern overlay.
- Larger, dramatic spacing system.
- Responsive design for tablet/desktop/mobile.
- Typography using 'KodeMono' font, with specific scales for headlines and body text.
- Smooth transitions and animations for interactive elements.
- Initial frontend sections include Landing, Blogs, Tools, Path, and Community, all initially with mocked data and client-side persistence (localStorage).
- The application needs to be professional and production ready, implying robust error handling, accessibility, SEO, and performance considerations.
- The backend must support data for Blogs, Tools, Path, and Community via FastAPI and MongoDB, including CRUD operations, pagination, filtering, and sorting.

<current_work>
The current state of the application is a hybrid, with a fully functional and polished frontend operating on mock data, and a production-ready backend with implemented and tested API endpoints.

On the **frontend side**:
-   The UI adheres strictly to the specified UI/UX guidelines, particularly the UIX-Labs dark theme (90/10 rule), featuring a black primary background, cyan-green accents, glass-morphism effects (18px blur), sharp-edged buttons, and custom typography using 'KodeMono'.
-   It includes a robust  for graceful error handling, debounced search functionality for Blogs, sorting for Tools, and an Enter-to-send feature for the Community chat.
-   Mobile navigation is implemented via a Sheet drawer, ensuring accessibility with proper labels and a skip-to-content link.
-   SEO and meta tags are configured in , and font preconnections are set up.
-   All user interactions (e.g., saving blog posts, tracking path completion, community chat) are currently persisted using  through , providing a realistic user experience without a live backend connection.

On the **backend side**:
-   FastAPI is used to provide robust API endpoints under the  prefix.
-   MongoDB serves as the database, storing data for various application sections.
-   Complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are implemented for Blogs, Tools, Path, and Community (including channels and messages), as detailed in .
-   The backend includes features like pagination, filtering, sorting, and basic 404/error handling.
-   Automated backend tests () have been executed, and all endpoints have passed, confirming their functionality. A minor bug related to blog date validation was identified and fixed during this testing phase.
-   A non-blocking backend health check is in place.

Essentially, the backend infrastructure is complete and validated, waiting to be connected to the frontend. The frontend is visually complete and interactive, but its data layer is still decoupled from the real backend.
